module Hyrax
  module Transactions
    ##
    # A transaction for creating a Work ready for use in Hyrax. Handles
    # ensuring admin sets and permission templates are present, and setting
    # system managed dates prior to save.
    #
    # @note This is an experimental replacement for the actor stack's `#create`
    #   stack. In time, we hope this will have feature parity with that stack,
    #   along with improved architecture, error handling, readability, and
    #   customizability. While this develops, please provide feedback.
    #
    # @since 2.4.0
    #
    # @example Creating a work transactionally
    #   work   = MyWork.new(title: ['Comet in Moominland'])
    #   result = Hyrax::Transactions::CreateWork.call(work)
    #   result.success? => true
    #
    # @example Handling errors with procedural style
    #   work   = MyWork.new # invalid work (no title)
    #   result = Hyrax::Transactions::CreateWork.call(work)
    #   result.success? => false
    #
    #   result.failure # => failure description or object
    #
    # @example Handling errors with `#or`
    #   work   = MyWork.new # invalid work (no title)
    #
    #   Hyrax::Transactions::CreateWork
    #     .call(work)
    #     .or { |error| handle_error(error) }
    #
    # @see https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-transaction/
    #
    # @todo add collection membership handling (@see CollectionsMembershipActor)
    # @todo set depositor (@see BaseActor)
    # @todo initialize workflow after save (@see BaseActor)
    # @todo add to parent works post-save (see: 'AddToWorkActor`)
    # @todo attach files (see: 'CreateWithFilesActor`, `CreateWithRemoteFilesActor`
    # @todo validate PermissionTemplate against visibility, lease, and embargo (see: `InterpretVisibilityActor`)
    # @todo add locking/transactionality. Just do better than the Actor Stack
    # @todo add support for proxy deposit (see: TransferRequestActor)
    #
    # @deprecated Development on Dry::Transaction has been discontinued, we're
    #   removing existing transactions and replacing them with Dry::Monad-based
    #   valkyrie versions.
