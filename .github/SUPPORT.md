# Getting Help

If you have questions or need help, please email [the Samvera community tech list](mailto:samvera-tech@googlegroups.com) or stop by the #dev channel in [the Samvera community Slack team](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87460391#Getintouch!-Slack).

The [Hyrax wiki](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/wiki) gathers documentation as the community tries things and learns what works. There is useful knowledge and history there but please keep in mind that this information can age quickly. Refer to the [README.md](./README.md) for the best updated guidance we have to offer.

You can also look in the [Samvera Community Knowledge Base](https://samvera.github.io) for help with Hyrax or other Samvera Community questions.

## Reporting Security Issues

To report a security vulnerability, email [samvera-steering@googlegroups.com](mailto:samvera-steering@googlegroups.com) and the Steering Group will coordinate the community response. In your message, please document to the best of your ability cases (relevant software versions, conditions, etc.) where the vulnerability is applicable, the potential negative effects, and any known workarounds or fixes to mitigate the risk. Steering will communicate this to the Partners and the rest of the community in a timely fashion.
