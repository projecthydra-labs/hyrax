## What is Hyrax?

Hyrax is a [Ruby on Rails Engine](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) built by the [Samvera community](https://samvera.org). Hyrax provides a foundation for creating many different digital repository applications.

_**Note:** As a Rails Engine, Hyrax is not a web application. To build your digital repository using Hyrax you must mount the Hyrax engine within a Rails application. We call an application that mounts Hyrax a "Hyrax-based application" (or sometimes a "Hyrax Application")._

Hyrax offers the ability to:

* Create repository object types on demand
* Deposit content via multiple configurable workflows
* Describe content with flexible metadata
* Enable/disable optional features via an administrative dashboard
* And more (https://hyrax.samvera.org/about/)

## Help

The Samvera community is here to help. Please see our [support guide](./.github/SUPPORT.md).

## Working with Hyrax

There are two primary Hyrax development concerns:

1. Developing the Hyrax engine
2. Developing your Hyrax-based Application

### Developing the Hyrax Engine

This is where you work on the code-base that will be used by yours and other Hyrax-based applications.  We recommend using [Docker and Hyrax's engine development containers](./CONTAINERS.md).

<aside><p><em><strong>Note:</em></strong> This is not the only path for Hyrax-engine development.  In the past, <a href="./documentation/legacyREADME.md">we documented extensive steps</a> to install the various dependencies for Hyrax-engine development.  By moving to Docker, we are encoding the documentation steps for standing up a Hyrax-engine development environment.</p></aside>

#### Contributing

We'd love to accept your contributions.  Please see our guide to [contributing to Hyrax](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Here are possible ways to help:

* The Hyrax user interface is translated into a number of languages, and many of these translations come from Google Translate. If you are a native or fluent speaker of a non-English language, your help improving these translations are most welcome. (Hyrax currently supports English, Spanish, Chinese, Italian, German, French, and Portuguese.)
  * Do you see English in the application where you would expect to see one of the languages above? If so, [file an issue](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/issues/new) and suggest a translation, please.
* [Contribute a user story](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/issues/new).
* Help us improve [Hyrax's test coverage](https://coveralls.io/r/samvera/hyrax) or [documentation coverage](https://inch-ci.org/github/samvera/hyrax).
* Refactor away [code smells](https://codeclimate.com/github/samvera/hyrax).

#### Release process

See the [release management process](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax/wiki/Release-management-process).

### Developing your Hyrax-based Application

For those familiar with Rails, this is where you create your own application (via `rails new`) and add Hyrax as a gem to your `Gemfile`.  Your Hyrax-based application is the place for you to create features specific to your Hyrax-based application.

For more information, see [our documentation on developing your Hyrax-based application](./documentation/developing-your-hyrax-based-app.md).
