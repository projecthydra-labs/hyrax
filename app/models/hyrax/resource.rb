module Hyrax
  ##
  # The base Valkyrie model for Hyrax.
  #
  # @note Hyrax permissions are managed via
  #   [Access Control List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list)
  #   style permissions. Legacy Hyrax models powered by `ActiveFedora` linked
  #   the ACLs from the repository object itself (as an `acl:accessControl` link
  #   to a container). Valkyrie models jettison that approach in favor of relying
  #   on links back from the permissions using `access_to`. As was the case in
  #   the past implementation, we include an object to represent the access list
  #   itself (`Hyrax::AccessControl`). This object's `#access_to` is the way
  #   Hyrax discovers list entries--it MUST match between the `AccessControl`
  #   and its individual `Permissions`.
  #
  #   The effect of this change is that our `AccessControl` objects are detached
  #   from `Hyrax::Resource` they can (and usually should) be edited and
  #   persisted independently from the resource itself.
  #
  #   Some utilitiy methods are provided for ergonomics in transitioning from
  #   `ActiveFedora`: the `#visibility` accessor, and the `#*_users` and
  #   `#*_group` accessors. The main purpose of these is to provide a cached
  #   ACL attached to a given Resource instance. However, these will likely be
  #   deprecated in the future, and it's advisable to avoid them in favor of
  #   `Hyrax::AccessControlList`, `Hyrax::PermissionManager` and/or
  #   `Hyrax::VisibilityWriter` (which provide their underlying
  #   implementations).
